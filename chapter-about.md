# About This Book

The original *Wrangling F1 Data With R* was written before the full range of "Tidy" tools was available.

Rather than add new recipes to that book in the same R style, or confuse matters by moving to a rather tidier vernacular,
I thought a fresh start mught be in order.

Hence, *More Wrangling F1 Data With R*.
